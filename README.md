# test-task-sv
Task description:
```
It is necessary to make a SpringBoot application,
which will have only one REST endpoint, which returns json with the name,
surname and age of the person by id. The application should have one RestController,
Service and Repository. Data about people will be stored in the database:
name, surname and date of birth. The service will consider the person's age. 
Any embedded database should be selected for the program to work. 
Use Spring Data to work with the database. It should start with the start of the program. 
You should write tests (unit + e2e). Any compiler at your discretion.
You can use spring initializr. The program must be successfully built, 
and the tests must be passed. The version of java and all dependencies is any. 
The code should be launched in a separate git repository, and a link should be 
provided after execution.
```
